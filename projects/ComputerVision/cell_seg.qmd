_Segment individual cells in cancer cell lines._

I use my own approach of switching between classification and semantic segmentation with a simple U-Net (sharing a backbone and separating individual cells in postprocessing) as well as the direct use of instance segmentation with Detectron2. Of course the (ResNet32/50) U-Net models can not keep up with the Mask-RCNN Detectron uses, but it still gained about 10% Map IoU when using this approach.
