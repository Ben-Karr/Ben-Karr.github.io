_Build a dataset of photos of electronic circuits, that are either fully functioning or broken at different place._

I cropped, resized and labeled the images with a lot of additional information to make it easy to train a CNN while accounting for different situations, that would occour in “reality”. This helped to understand in which situation the classifier predicts reliably and to adapt the data collection process.
