_A React web app that visualizes gradient descent in 3D._

[![](../assets/3d-gradients_impression.png)](https://ben-karr.github.io/react-3d-gradients/)

With this app you can:

::: {.left-flush}
* manually fit a quadratic function to some data,
* use a Stepper to automatically step the parameters towards the local minimum,
* have a look at the trace the loss left as it walked through the loss surface,
* choose from different critics (`mae`,`mse`,`rmse`) to “see” how changing the way we measure the loss effects gradient descent,
* intuitively interact with the 3D-plot by dragging and zoom, to keep the interesting parts in focus.
