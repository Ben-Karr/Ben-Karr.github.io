_Predict the scores of NCAA basketball games._

[![](../assets/BasketballScores_example.png)]({{< meta gh-link >}})

This dataset consisted of game results from the last 5 years in NCAA basketball. Since it was sourced by scraping the web, I needed to do a lot of cleaning and preparation of the source and engineered some useful features to train a Neural Net with keras. I also compared it to the results of fastai and XGBoost.
