_Predict the housing prices in a kaggle competition._

[![](../assets/HousePricing_example.png)]({{< meta gh-link >}})

This dataset consists of 79 features about sold houses but came with a lot of missing values which had to be filled manually and apropriately. I learned a Neural Net and a Gradient Booster to predict the house prices and ensembled both learners to decrease the error value.
